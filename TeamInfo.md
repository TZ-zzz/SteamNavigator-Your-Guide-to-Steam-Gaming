## Project Summary

Our project is a website where users can access useful and important  information regarding steam games in a centralized and easily accessible place. To differentiate our website from already existing ones such as steam’s own website, we will not only provide simple static game information such as a game’s description and price, but also display advanced game analytics such as price and player count history data. Such data will be displayed through sophisticated graphs, interactive maps, and raw text that will transform the way users search for games. In addition, the website will incorporate sophisticated machine learning models to predict a game’s price at a certain point in time and implement a recommendation system based on a user’s preferences.

The main goal of this project is to develop a centralized hub where users can go to in order to get the most sophisticated and up to date information about a steam game.
